# About Me #

This is Munevver Calayir. I graduated from Galatasaray High School. I learned there 4 languages, English, French, Italian and basic latin. Then, I graduated from Bogazici University, Mathematics Department. Because of my interest on programming, I attended some courses about  HTML, CSS, Object Oriented Javascript Applications, jQuery Library, PHP, Mysql, Linux/Ubuntu Configuration. In addition to this, during my undergraduate program, I attended some Project Management Institute certified courses and these are Project Management Basis Education, Risk, Time, Cost and Finance Management Education, Organization Theory and HR Management Education.
From the high school years on, I was dreaming to founding my own company. I was also interested in foreign trade. With this push, I attended Applied Foreign Trade Training and KOSGEB Enterpreneurship Training; and during them I found some interesting and niche -for Turkey- products and applied to their manufacturer companies to be their sole agency in Turkey with my business plan. It started like that and I found my company. After a while, I married. My husband was working on a similar area and we united our companies under the name of "Gilbo". And now, we are the sole distributor of many robotic and technology company from Korea, Canada, Germany, France, Japan, U.S.A., England. We also founded an online trade system, "Robotsepeti.com"
When it comes to my personal interest, I like to riding and playing tennis. I do like scubadiving. After birth of my daughter, I started to do some other passtime at home. I transformed my balcony to a colorfull flover garden including all wall surface. I grow also water plants in my giant aquarium. I really do like also building self growing terrariums and designing their inside as if they are miniature peysage with bonsai trees, mini mountains, etc.
