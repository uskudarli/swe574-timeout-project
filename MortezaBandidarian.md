# About Me #

I am Morteza Bandidarian, born in 1989 in Tehran. Graduated in 2013 form IAU university in IT engineering. Actually my major focus in BS was in network fields but i changed my mind to change it to software engineering. So I do not have a real development experience in a company. I am familiar with java and php programming languages + database fundamentals and I am developing it more and more by myself everyday.Persian and Azerbaijani are my mother tongues. Turkish and English are my second and third languages. My major activity is playing classical guitar (in was member of modern music band in Tehran), I am movie eater, i saw most of cinema masterpieces. If i have time for tv, I prefer only national geographic channel.
