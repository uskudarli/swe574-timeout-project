# About Me #

I was born in Istanbul, Turkey. I graduated from Computer Education and Educational Technology, Marmara University,  in 2011. During the time I was studying, I have worked as a part-time software developer in Naryaz Bilgisayar. Then, with the graduation, I started to work in Triodor Software. I have worked for almost 3 years there. In February, 2014, I switched to Etiya and then Bilge Adam. Currently, I have been working for Bilge Adam in a hospital management project as Senior Java Developer.

I started my Master's degree in Software Engineering at Boğaziçi University in 2013. Due to the fact that I have been working and studying at the same time, I decided to take 2-3 lessons per semester. I have planned to finish my Master's degree in Februay, 2016.
