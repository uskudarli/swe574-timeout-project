# About Me #

My name is Sezgi Seret. I was born in Istanbul and grew up there. I graduated from Vienna University of Technology, Computer Science Department, in March 2009. I have gained a lot of advantages with studying abroad such as learning a foreign language, gain self-confidence and learn to live alone.

I work as a Online & Data Services Management Senior Specialist at Vodafone Turkey since August 2014. At the same time, I am studying for my master degree in Software Engineering since September 2013. Handling my work and my studies at the same time requires a good time management and I try to balance my life.

My favourite hobby is tennis. Tennis is not easy to play but an elegant sport that requires high-toned skills. That is why I like it so much. Besides that, I also like to swim, travel, rollerblading and skating.
