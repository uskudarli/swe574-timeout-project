## What is Linked Data ##

A term used to describe a recommended best practice for exposing, sharing, and connecting pieces of data, information, and knowledge on the Semantic Web using URIs and RDF.

## Principles ##

  1. Use URIs as names for things
  1. Use HTTP URIs so that people can look up those names.
  1. When someone looks up a URI, provide useful information.
  1. Include links to other URIs. so that they can discover more things.

## Three Simple Rules according to [Tim Berners-Lee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee) ##

  1. All kinds of conceptual things, they have names now that start with HTTP.
  1. If I take one of these HTTP names and I look it up [..] I will get back some data in a standard format which is kind of useful data that somebody might like to know about that thing, about that event.
  1. When I get back that information it's not just got somebody's height and weight and when they were born, it's got relationships. And when it has relationships, whenever it expresses a relationship then the other thing that it's related to is given one of those names that starts with HTTP.

## Pros & Cons ##

  * **Pros :** rich, public, diverse, knowledge base.
  * **Cons:** huge, distributed, on the web.

## Glossary ##

  * **URI  :** In computing, a uniform resource identifier (URI) is a string of characters used to identify a name of a resource. Such identification enables interaction with representations of the resource over a network, typically the World Wide Web, using specific protocols. Schemes specifying a concrete syntax and associated protocols define each URI. The most common form of URI is the uniform resource locator (URL), frequently referred to informally as a web address.

  * **RDF :** Resource Description Framework The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a family of World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) specifications originally designed as a metadata data model.
