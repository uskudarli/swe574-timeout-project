# Introduction #

Preparing content for platforms that do not yet exist means investing in content enrichment, or “smart” content. Most content exists in unstructured, “flat” files with long lines of text—Word documents, PDFs, and application files such as Adobe InDesign. Files such as these are difficult to process automatically because they require interpretation by human beings.
XML approaches this problem by structuring format and style. But **semantic tagging** brilliantly addresses not just what content looks like, but **what it means.**
